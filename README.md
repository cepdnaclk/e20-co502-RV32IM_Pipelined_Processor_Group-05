## RV32IM Pipeline Processor Design

This project focuses on designing a 32-bit RISC-V RV32IM pipeline processor with five stages: Instruction Fetch (IF), Decode (ID), Execute (EX), Memory Access (MEM), and Write Back (WB). The processor supports the RV32I base instructions and the M-extension for integer multiplication and division. The design emphasizes efficient instruction flow with minimized hazards, utilizing forwarding and stalling for data hazards and branch prediction for control hazards.

The processor is implemented using Verilog , simulated with tools like ModelSim, and tested using the RISC-V toolchain and compliance tests. Performance optimizations include pipeline balancing and optional cache integration for faster memory access. The project delivers a functional HDL codebase, test results, and optionally, an FPGA prototype.

This design project enhances understanding of processor architecture, pipelining, and ISA implementation, providing a solid foundation for exploring advanced computer engineering concepts.

## Key Features of the RV32IM Processor
